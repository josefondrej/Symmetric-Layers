Symmetric Layers for Neural Networks
====================================================

Suppose our data follows the model

$$
    y = f(x)
$$

and suppose that the value of $f$ does not depend on the permutation of coordinates of $x \in R^n$.
If we try to model $f$ with standard neural network this is a problem. This project proposes one approach for
solving it.
